# Traveling Salesman Problem – Genetic Algorithm Approach

This repository presents a simple optimization demo for the Traveling Salesman Problem using a genetic algorithm.

- The goal of the project is to demonstrate the basic components of a genetic algorithm, selection, crossover, and mutation applied to a classical combinatorial optimization problem.  
- The implementation is intended for educational purposes rather than as a production-level solver.
- The Traveling Salesman Problem aims to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting point.  

## Method
A genetic algorithm is used as a heuristic optimization strategy:
- Randomly generated initial population of routes
- Fitness evaluation based on total path length
- Selection of better-performing routes
- Crossover and mutation to explore the search space
Run the script directly to observe how the best path length evolves over generations.
